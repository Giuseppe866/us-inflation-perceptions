Language: Italian (with references to English literature)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This repository contains the thesis document and supplementary material related to an in-depth empirical and theoretical analysis of inflation in the United States, with a particular focus on **consumer perceptions and expectations** of inflation between 2016 and 2023.

The thesis investigates the gap between official inflation data and how individuals *perceive* and *expect* inflation. It combines macroeconomic theory, empirical modeling, and data analysis using publicly available datasets (e.g., University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, FRED, Google Trends) to uncover demographic discrepancies and behavioral insights.

KEY THEMES
----------
- Recent evolution of U.S. inflation (post-COVID shock)
- Role of monetary policy and interest rates
- Use of Google Trends as a proxy for inflation awareness
- Formation of inflation expectations and perceptions
- Demographic analysis (by gender and income brackets)
- Quantitative mismatch between actual inflation and perceived inflation
- Anchoring of long-term inflation expectations
- Policy implications for central banks (e.g., FED)

CONTENTS
--------
- ðŸ“„ `Difonzo_Giuseppe.pdf`: Full thesis (in Italian)
- ðŸ“Š Figures and regression outputs from University of Michigan Surveys
- ðŸ“š Comprehensive bibliography (including Bernanke, Lucas, Ashton, Coibion, D'Acunto, and others)

METHODOLOGY
-----------
- **Time series analysis** of inflation (2016â€“2023)
- **Linear regression models** to explain mismatch between perceived and actual inflation
- **Demographic breakdowns** of perception vs. reality
- **Use of median** (instead of mean) to avoid outliers' distortion
- **Google Trends** as a proxy for consumer inflation interest
- **Comparison of short- vs. long-term expectations**

KEY FINDINGS
------------
- Inflation perceptions are systematically higher than actual inflation, especially for **women** and **low-income groups**.
- **Short-term inflation expectations** are strongly influenced by current perceptions.
- **Long-term inflation expectations**, however, remain **well anchored** near the 2% FED target, even during inflationary shocks.
- Consumer sentiment plays a critical role in shaping expectations, confirming the need for clear central bank communication.

- Researchers studying behavioral economics and inflation
- Central bank analysts

- Anyone interested in inflation dynamics and expectations theory
